# 🌌 Nightly Sky — Landing Page

A clean and minimal landing page from my **Night Sky** template series ✨.
This is a **free-to-use** project built just for fun and learning. It comes with **multiple themes**, is **responsive** (well… except the navbar for now 😅), and was my first quick build.

It may have some bugs here and there, but I’ll keep improving it. 🚀
